                <li class="big-text">What is JavaScript?</li>
            </ol>
            <ul class="small-text">
                <li>JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the
                    client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive.</li>
                <li>Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web
                    pages interactive elements that engage a user.</li>
            </ul>

                <li class="big-text">What is the use of isNaN function? </li>
            </ol>
            <ul class="small-text">
                <li>The isNaN() function is used to check whether a given value is an illegal
                    number or not.</li>
                <li>It returns true if value is a NaN else returns false.</li>
                <li>It is different from the Number.</li>
            </ul>

            <ol type="1" start="3">
                <li class="big-text">What is negative Infinity?</li>
            </ol>
            <ul class="small-text">
                <li>The value of Number. NEGATIVE_INFINITY is the same as the negative value
                    of the global object's Infinity property. This value behaves slightly
                    differently than mathematical infinity: Any positive value, including</li>
            </ul>

            <ol type="1" start="4">
                <li class="big-text">Which company developed JavaScript?</li>
            </ol>
            <ul class="small-text">
                <li> The first ever JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich at Netscape, and has
                    since been updated to conform to ECMA-262 Edition 5 and later versions.</li>
            </ul>

            <ol type="1" start="5">
                <li class="big-text">What are undeclared and undefined variables?</li>
            </ol>
            <ul class="small-text">
                <li>The difference between undefined and undeclared variables in JavaScript
                    is: Undefined variable means a variable has been declared but it does not
                    have a value. </li>
                <li>Undeclared variable means that the variable does not exist
                    in the program at all.</li>
            </ul>

            <ol type="1" start="6">
                <li class="big-text">Write the code for adding new elements dynamically?</li>
            </ol>
            <ul class="small-text">
                <li>New elements can be dynamically created in JavaScript with the help of createElement() method. </li>
            </ul>

            <ol type="1" start="7">
                <li class="big-text">What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?</li>
            </ol>
            <ul class="small-text">
                <li>The basic difference between these two is that the ViewState is to manage
                    state at the client's end, making state management easy for end-user while
                    SessionState manages state at the server's end, making it easy to manage
                    content from this end too. ViewState: It is maintained at only one level
                    that is page-level.</li>
            </ul>

            <ol type="1" start="8">
                <li class="big-text">What is === operator?</li>
            </ol>
            <ul class="small-text">
                <li>The strict equality operator ( === ) checks whether its two operands are
                    equal, returning a Boolean result.</li>
                <li> Unlike the equality operator, the
                    strict equality operator always considers operands of different types to
                    be different.</li>
            </ul>

            <ol type="1" start="9">
                <li class="big-text">How can the style/class of an element be changed?</li>
            </ol>
            <ul class="small-text">
                <li>Another way to alter the style of an element is by changing its class
                    attribute.</li>
                <li> class is a reserved word in JavaScript, so in order to access
                    the element's class, you use element. className .</li>
            </ul>

            <ol type="1" start="10">
                <li class="big-text">How to read and write a file using JavaScript?</li>

            <ul class="small-text">
                <li>File=fopen(getScriptPath(),0); The function fread() is used for reading
                    the file content.</li>
                <li>Str = fread(file,flength(file) ; The function fwrite() is used to write
                    the contents to the file</li>
                <li>File = fopen("c:\MyFile.txt", 3);// opens the file for writing.</li>

            <ol type="1" start="11">
                <li class="big-text">What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?</li>
            </ol>
            <ul class="small-text">
                <li>For - loops through a block of code a number of times.</li>
                <li>For/in - loops through the properties of an object.</li>
                <li>For/of - loops through the values of an iterable object.</li>
                <li>While - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.</li>
            </ul>

            <ol type="1" start="12">
                <li class="big-text">How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript?</li>
            </ol>
            <ul class="small-text">
                <li>In JavaScript parseInt() function (or a method) is used to convert the passed in string parameter or
                    value to an
                    integer value itself.</li>
                <li>This function returns an integer of base which is specified in second argument of parseInt()
                    function.</li>
            </ul>

            <ol type="1" start="13">
                <li class="big-text">What is the function of the delete operator?</li>
            </ol>
            <ul class="small-text">
                <li>The delete operator removes a given property from an object. On successful deletion, it will return
                    true , else false
                    will be returned. </li>
                <li>However, it is important to consider the following scenarios: If the property which you are trying
                    to delete does not exist, delete will not have any effect and will return true .</li>
            </ul>

                <li class="big-text">What is the use of Void (0)?</li>
            </ol>
            <ul class="small-text">
                <li>JavaScript void 0 means returning undefined (void) as a primitive value. </li>
                <li>You might come across the term
